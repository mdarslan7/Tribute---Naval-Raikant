# Naval-Tribute-Website

I made this website as the second assesment of Web Development given by UPES Open Community. This website is dedicated to Naval Ravikant, an angel investor, entrepreneur and philosoper. My life has changed since I started listening to Naval. He has helped me grow as a person both emotionally & spiritually. The sole intention of this website is to present brilliant and valuable bits of advice, guidance & lifelong learnings of Naval through showcasing some of his best podcasts which will add value to your lives.
